#     News Area spreads (should be slower than messages) maybe just expand ring every tick?
    # But how will we track which news should be given to which commander (just the new ring, or the outer two layers?)


def message(message):
    #calculate time between sent and now
    #Should have had been arrived? DO THE CHECK!

    #If check fail, put an item on a location on the map
    #If check succeed, put in to discordbot order queue
